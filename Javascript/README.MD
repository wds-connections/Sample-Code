the nature of the availability is that, the software(browser[*content*]) doesn't have to be compiled;<br>
this way enabling different document engines being performed to new instructions every new presentation;<br>

on wich the flexibility to construct a presentation are not held on object types in a disposable development manner;<br>

the ability to induce a open source concept, artistically where softwares are movie like productions<br>
prevents a better quality as the personal computer productivity tends of being somebody stalking activity<br>
where the closed source are held in communities expecting to process the reality of the availability being social consumers;
